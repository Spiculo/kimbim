## Needs a spike

These are listed in [07-roadmap.md](07-roadmap.md#spikes-do-first-each-is-small-throwaway-and-documented).

- S1: shared in-memory IFC between C++ and Python.
- S2: OCCT viewer performance at 100k objects.
- S3: lossless record decomposition on the corpus.
- S4: cross-platform hash equality.
- S5: gitoxide performance at 1M blobs.

## Design details to settle during implementation

- The exact canonical JSON schema: attribute naming, how SELECT types and typed values (`IfcLabel("x")`) are encoded, aggregates of aggregates.
- The size threshold that moves geometry into separate records.
- Ownership rules for non-rooted entities that are referenced by several roots without a clear owner.
- Representing IFC2X3 files: convert to IFC4 on import, or store natively by schema?
- Where saved views, drawing definitions and library references live (in-model IFC entities vs `kimcad.toml`).
- Undo across "Save version": can you undo past a commit, or does a commit reset the undo stack?
- Spanish terminology for UI and IFC display labels: pick one regional variant (neutral Latin American vs. Spain) or ship both?
- Community: where the project lives (Codeberg/GitHub), communication channel, and its relationship with the OSArch / IfcOpenShell communities. Upstreaming fixes to IfcOpenShell is strongly encouraged.
